# A-star-search

This repository contains an implementation of the A* Search algorithm that solves the sliding 8-puzzle. This project was a part of my Machine Reasoning course at Davidson College in the Fall of 2020. 

Three heuristics were implemented:
  - Misplaced tiles
  - Manhattan distance
  - Linear conflict

We were tasked with performing experiments with our algorithm and writing a research paper on our results.
